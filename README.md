Created an easy to use API that could break into any OS that used the Merkleâ€“Hellman knapsack cryptosystem as primary defensive strategy by plugging the USB into the computer.


*N.B. I have not included the remote access scripts that I had assisted in creation of for obvious security reasons.
For the USB remote access login scripts, please contact me at razao@purdue.edu.
